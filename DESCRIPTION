Author: Blake Madden
Maintainer: Blake Madden <seasweptdreams@gmail.com>
Description: Takes an SVG path and partially fills it with a specified color.
             This can be useful for infographics, showing how much something is complete or a creative alternative to bar charts.
             The returned objects are a (character vector) image block that can be embedded into HTML output and the updated SVG text.
             A set of predefined polygons are also included.
